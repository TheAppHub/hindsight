## Flamin' Good's Bold New Identity.

The brief to Hindsight was to create a brand name and identity for a new restaurant and take-away unique to the launch location. 

Our team at Hindsight Creative crafted a custom logo featuring a ‘hot bird’ surrounded by flames, blending striking black, orange, and white tones.

The logo is all about attitude and flavour, capturing the fiery essence of this unique restaurant and takeaway spot.

### Every corner as bold as its flavours.

When it comes to Flamin’ Good Charcoal Chicken, we made sure the exterior says it all.

With eye-catching signage that boasts phrases like ‘DINE IN OUR HOT BAR’ and bold branding in black and orange, this shopfront is designed to stop you in your tracks.

Whether you’re walking by or driving past, there’s no mistaking the fiery, delicious experience waiting inside.
