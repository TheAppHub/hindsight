## Introducing Kubota Australia’s all-new U10-5 - A small giant in the excavator world.

When Kubota launched their U10-5 compact excavator, it needed a campaign that showcased its prowess in tight spaces. Our comprehensive digital marketing strategy included video, social media, and diverse digital content, all designed to shine a spotlight on this compact little dynamo.

### Proving the best things come in super-small packages.

Our campaign focused on the U10-5’s unique capabilities, appealing to new and existing customers and dealerships. We created detailed product walkaround videos showcasing the excavator in suburban settings – exactly where it excels. This close-up look at the U10-5 in action demonstrated its agility and power, cementing its place in the market.

Our digital marketing agency team then shifted gears to announce this mighty mini excavator’s arrival on the scene via social media. We created EDMs outlining its core features and benefits. For dealers, we produced detailed information booklets and comparison sheets. We also scripted, filmed and edited a launch walkaround video showing the U10-r zipping into suburban garages and scooting down side alleys to showcase all it could do and where.
