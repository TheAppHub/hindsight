## Kubota’s video marketing triumph In a Place We Call Home

### Real stories. Real impact

Our collaboration with Kubota and Channel Nine’s “The Block” provided an exciting opportunity to create a brand commercial that resonated with audiences nationwide.

We focused on real-life applications of Kubota machinery, weaving authentic stories into a compelling narrative that aired during 2022’s season of The Block, proudly sponsored by Kubota.

### Capturing the essence of Kubota

We knew we weren’t just showcasing machinery. Our video content focused on capturing the spirit of Kubota in Australians’ everyday lives.

Filming across three locations in Flinders Island, Red Hill and Mt Pleasant Estate, we brought Kubota’s script to life with professional voiceovers and edits to create 10 variations for social media and dealership TVCs.

From defining Kubota’s values to concepts and storyboarding, our story shows how Kubota makes work lighter for real people, every day.
