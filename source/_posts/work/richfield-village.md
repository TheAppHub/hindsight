## Rebranding Richfield. More than just a lifestyle village.

Richfield Village, an architectural award-winning haven for over 55s, desperately needed a brand facelift. Our mission? To revitalise its brand identity, transforming it to a beacon of luxury and quality.

### Elegance reimagined: A new visual era.

We waved goodbye to the old, dated visual elements and welcomed a new era of elegance. The redesigned Richfield type mark now whispers prestige, and is fully aligned with the modern facilities and exquisite decor.

This rebrand wasn’t just about a new logo—it was about creating an entire suite of visually stunning materials from printed collateral to detailed signage manufacture and an updated website.
