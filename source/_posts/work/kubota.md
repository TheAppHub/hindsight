## Realising Kubota’s vision for a scalable website

In today’s digital landscape, with technology advancing user expectations, Kubota Australia identified a critical need for a website that would be scalable, adaptable, fast loading, editable and ‘future proof’ – accommodating growth, technological advancements and provide a seamless and optimal user experience across all devices and platforms.

### Web design fuelled by logic and the user experience


An audit of Kubota’s previous website highlighted several key challenges in delivering a website to meet Kubota’s expectations for editing, ease of use, delivering promotions and allowing for future customer and dealer applications.

Hindsight’s work began with an extensive research phase, which included competitive assessment, client requirements and web architecture and coding languages. The outcome of which was to deliver a logical presentation of the client’s information and resources in a manner that would be fast to load, easy to keep up-to-date and grow with planned integration of applications.

To-date Kubota’s website contains more than 900 pages which are image intensive. To enable a fast render of the pages on the client side, all pages are pre-loaded on the server side. This function means all the various website components are already rendered when a viewer logs on to the website, making the user experience agile and fluid. 

To further assist with the load speed for users, we have deployed the website on a Content Delivery Network hosted on multiple servers worldwide. For Kubota, the technology that has been adopted will be the keystone for an enhanced user eperience in the future.
