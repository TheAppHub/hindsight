## The Kalevu Marina relaunch.

Kalevu Marina came to us with ambition — to evolve into Sydney’s most refined waterfront destination. Nestled in Sylvania Waters, this premium marina needed a brand to match the level of luxury it offered.

We reimagined their identity from the wave up. A sculpted ‘K’ logo with dynamic curves, a bold yet elegant typeface, and a cool-toned coastal palette delivered instant sophistication. The refreshed brand captures both the calm of the marina and the strength of the sea — a balance of serenity and authority.

### Where strategy meets the sea.

A cohesive social media strategy was rolled out with tailored content pillars and versatile caption sets. From lifestyle-led Instagram stories to email campaigns that welcome and convert, every touchpoint now tells the Kalevu story — a place where prestige, community and the coastline meet.
