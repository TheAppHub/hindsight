## Designed to defend and stand out.

We dove deep into research to create a brand identity that reflects the strength and protection for Sharkguard by Trident.

From competitor analysis to naming the product, we crafted a bold identity that resonates. The name Sharkguard emerged from our vision of security, drawing inspiration from the power and fierceness of the ocean’s greatest predators.

We didn’t stop there—our team also developed names like Great White, Mako, Manta, and Bull for the anti-climb fence profiles, further tying the branding to the Sharkguard theme.

### It's not what you sell - it's how you sell it.

We didn’t just develop a brand identity for Sharkguard by Trident - we brought it to life with stunning 3D renders that showcase the precision of their galvanised steel profiles.

Whether on a website or in a brochure, these renders highlight the product's strength and versatility, available in various Colorbond shades.

We also created eye-catching packaging that stands out, with strong callouts to communicate the product’s key features and make it retail-ready.
