## Sport a new look and become a Cult Figure.

Cult Club Gear’s mission was to develop a new website with a bold colour palette infused with team spirit and club culture.

Our task? To create a brand identity and web interface that were simple to navigate and visually striking. We decided that creating a Cult range of uniforms using 3D technology, instead of conventional photography, would offer a cleaner, stronger representation of their product.

### From concept to courtside – The Cult Club Gear story.

Our branding agency team’s approach for outdoor advertising was to develop a brand identity that’s both versatile and modern, reflecting the innate energy you see every weekend on the field…

The result? Quality branded merchandise and apparel with strong lines and colour blocking in patterns inspired by athletic motion. It’s super versatile and ready to go the distance, much like the product itself.
