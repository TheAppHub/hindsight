## Mount Pleasant. My Place.

The heart of Mount Pleasantâ€™s vision lies in its seamless mix of nature and urban convenience.

From eye-catching billboards to the final sales office fit-out, every piece of marketing collateral was designed to immerse future residents in the beauty of Mount Pleasant.

### A brand is more than just a logo.

When Mount Pleasant approached us to craft a visual identity for their master-planned community, we knew it had to reflect their stunning blend of idyllic rural charm and modern urban values.

The result? A logo inspired by rolling hills, refined typography aimed at young families, and a visual identity that feels as elevated as the estate itself.
