    bio: "Andy likes his coffee instant, often several times reheated, with extra milk please. On a typical Friday night, you'll find him relishing in the company of his family or a few close mates on his outdoor deck, cheering on their favourite seasonal sport. With a penchant for classic design, his favourite font is the timeless Avant Garde. While Andy's most utilised office tool is InDesign, he also gives the microwave a good workout. Andy's dream holiday would include the exploration of archaeological wonders somewhere fascinating like the Polynesian Islands or Mexico, and his favourite thing about Hindsight is the light-hearted banter and open collaboration which permeates his team, creating an environment where creativity flourishes."

Japan is next on Adam's Holiday bucket list, even if the thought of him leaving the office for an extended period has the team looking nervously at the printers.
