  heading: More Than a First Impression
  copy:
  - From the unboxing experience to the collateral you hand out at events, every touchpoint should reinforce your brand identity, communicate your value, and support your marketing strategy.
  - When done well, product packaging becomes more than just a container, it becomes a brand moment. Great packaging and print material can influence purchasing decisions, enhance credibility, and create moments of connection between your brand and your audience.
