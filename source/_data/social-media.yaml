    - Every social media package begins with a Custom Brand Strategy because successful social media needs more than just good content — it needs direction. For a one-time investment of $2200, we’ll deliver a tangible, brand-specific strategy you can use to guide your content, structure your socials and align your team. 
    - It includes a digital audit, competitor and market analysis, audience personas, platform recommendations, content pillars, tone of voice, strategic themes, caption examples, updates to your bio and highlights — and more. Whether you're managing your socials in-house or working with us long-term, this becomes the foundation for better content, stronger engagement and lasting results.
